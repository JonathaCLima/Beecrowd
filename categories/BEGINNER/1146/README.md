# Growing Sequences
Your program must read an integer **X** indefinited times (the program must stop when **X** is equal to zero). For each **X** print the sequence from 1 to **X**, with one space between each one of these numbers.

PS: Be carefull. Don't leave any space after the last number of each line, otherwise you'll get ***Presentation Error***.

## Input
The input contains two integer numbers X (1 < X < 20) and Y (X < Y < 100000).

## Output
For each number N of the input file, one output line must be printed, from 1 to N like the following example. Be careful with blank spaces after the last line number.
