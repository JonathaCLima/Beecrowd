# Lowest Number and Position
Write a program that reads a number **N**. This **N** is the size of a array **X**[*N*]. Next, read each of the numbers of **X**, find the smallest element of this array and its position within the array, printing this information.

## Input
The first line of input contains one integer **N** (1 < **N** <1000), indicating the number of elements that should be read to an array **X**[*N*] of integer numbers. The second row contains each of the **N** values, separated by a space. Remember that no input will have repeated numbers.

## Output
The first line displays the message “Menor valor:” followed by a space and the lowest number read in the input. The second line displays the message “Posicao:” followed by a space and the array position in which the lowest number is, remembering that the array starts at the zero position.
