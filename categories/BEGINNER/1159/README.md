# Sum of Consecutive Even Numbers
The program must read an integer **X** indefinite times (stop when **X=0**). For each **X**, print the sum of five consecutive even numbers from **X**, including it if **X** is even. If the input number is 4, for example, the output must be 40, that is the result of the operation: 4+6+8+10+12. If the input number is 11, for example, the output must be 80, that is the result of 12+14+16+18+20.

## Input
The input file contains many integer numbers. The last one is zero.

## Output
Print the output according to the example below.
