# Our Days Are Never Coming Back
So, have you l̲iked the Wi̲nter School this year? In order to make this School happen, many have worked, whether in writing the problems, in conf̲iguring the̲ Portal, i̲n making the arrengements̲ for the even̲t o̲r in raising t̲he funds. Our specia̲l acknowledgement this year goes to Professor Ricardo Oliveira, who has not only accep̲ted our̲ invitatio̲n to come and teach the workshops b̲ut has al̲so bee̲n participating on the organisation of this School. We are sure that his experience and his career at ICPC as contestant and as coach have m̲otived and inspired us all.

We hope you have enjoyed t̲hese last days in Esso̲s and in Westeros, we hope you have learned a lot and had fun. B̲ut it is not only in Essos and in We̲steros̲ that yo̲u shoul̲d hav̲e fun. Here, in Be̲yond the Wall, programming is also fun. Keep studying, keep training, and more and more. What is important is the path you choose to pursue from now on. Our ad̲vice is that you should always enjoy every single moment, every workshop, every school, every training session, every time practicing or studying at home. Our days are never coming back.
