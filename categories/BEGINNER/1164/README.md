# Perfect Number
In mathematics, a perfect number is an integer for which the sum of all its own positive divisors (excluding itself) is equal to the number itself. For example the number 6 is perfect, because 1+2+3 is equal to 6. Your task is to write a program that read integer numbers and print a message informing if these numbers are perfect or are not perfect.

## Input
The input contains several test cases. The first contains the number of test cases **N** (1 ≤ **N** ≤ 100). Each one of the following **N** lines contains an integer **X** (1 ≤ **X** ≤ 10⁸), that can be or not a perfect number.

## Output
For each test case print the message “**X** eh perfeito” (**X** is perfect) or “**X** nao eh perfeito” (**X** isn't perfect) according with to above specification.
