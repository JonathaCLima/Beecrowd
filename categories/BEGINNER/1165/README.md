# Prime Number
A Prime Number is a number that is divisible only by 1 (one) and by itself. For example the number 7 is Prime, because it can be divided only by 1 and by 7.

## Input
The input contains several test cases. The first contains the number of test cases **N** (1 ≤ **N** ≤ 100). Each one of the following **N** lines contains an integer **X** (1 < **X** ≤ 107), that can be or not a prime number.

## Output
For each test case print the message “**X** eh primo” (**X** is prime) or “**X** nao eh primo” (**X** isn't prime) according with to above specification.
