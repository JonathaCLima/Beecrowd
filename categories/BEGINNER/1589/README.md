# Bob Conduit
You have gotten two circular energy cables. The first one has radius R1 and the second R2. You need to buy a circular conduit (see the image below) that fits those two cables:

What is the smallest radius of a conduit you need to buy? In other words, given two circles, what is the smallest radius of a third circle that circumscribe the other two?

## Input
In the first line there is an integer **T** (**T** ≤ 10000), indicating the number of test cases.

On the only line of each test case we will have the two integers **R1** and **R2** indicating the cables radius. The integers will be positive and all the math will fit in a regular integer of 32 bits.

## Output
In each test case, output the answer in a single line.
