# Sphere
Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius (R) . The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * RÂ³. Consider (assign) for pi the value 3.14159.

Tip: Use (4/3.0) or (4.0/3) in your formula, because some languages (including C++) assume that the division's result between two integers is another integer. :)

## Input
The input contains a value of floating point (double precision).

## Output
The output must be a message "VOLUME" like the following example with a space before and after the equal signal. The value must be presented with 3 digits after the decimal point.

| Input Samples |      Output Samples      |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| 3             | VOLUME = 113.097         |
| 15            | VOLUME = 14137.155       |
| 1523          | VOLUME = 14797486501.627 |
