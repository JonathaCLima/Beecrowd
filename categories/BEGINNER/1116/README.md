# Dividing X by Y
Write a program that read two numbers X and Y and print the result of dividing the X by Y. If it's not possible, print the message "divisao impossivel".

## Input
The input contains an integer number **N**. This **N** is the quantity of pairs of integer numbers X and Y read (dividend and divisor).

## Output
For each test case print the result of this division with one digit after the decimal point, or “divisao impossivel” if it isn't possible to perform the calculation.

**Obs.:** Be carefull. The division between two integers in some languages generates another integer. Use cast:)
