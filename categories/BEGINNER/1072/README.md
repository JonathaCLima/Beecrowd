# Interval 2
Read an integer **N**. This N will be the number of integer numbers **X** that will be read.

Print how many these numbers **X** are in the interval [10,20] and how many values are out of this interval.

## Input
The first line of input is an integer **N** (**N** < 10000), that indicates the total number of test cases.
Each case is an integer number **X** (-10⁷ < **X** < 10⁷).

## Output
For each test case, print how many numbers are in and how many values are out of the interval.
