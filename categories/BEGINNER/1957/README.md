# Converting to Hexadecimal
Data stored in computers are in binary. An economic way of visualizing these numbers is the usage of base 16 (hexadecimal).

Your task is to write a program that, given a natural number at base 10, shows its representation in hexadecimal.

## Input
The input is a positive integer number **V** at base 10 (1 ≤ **V** ≤ 2 x 10⁹).

## Output
The output is the same number **V** at base 16 in a single line (don't forget the end-of-line character). Use uppercase letters, as shown in the examples.

| Input Samples | Output Samples |
|---------------|----------------|
| 10            | A              |
| 15            | F              |
| 16            | 10             |
| 31            | 1F             |
| 65535         | FFFF           |
