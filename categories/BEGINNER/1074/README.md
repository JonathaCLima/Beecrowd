# Even or Odd
Read an integer value **N**. After, read these N values and print a message for each value saying if this value is *odd*, *even*, *positive* or *negative*. In case of zero (0), although the correct description would be "EVEN NULL", because by definition zero is even, your program must print only "NULL", without quotes.

## Input
The first line of input is an integer **N** (**N** < 10000), that indicates the total number of test cases. Each case is a integer number **X** (-10⁷ < **X** <10⁷)..

## Output
For each test case, print a corresponding message, according to the below example. All messages must be printed in uppercase letters and always will have one space *between* two words in the same line.
