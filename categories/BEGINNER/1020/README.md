# Age in Days
Read an integer value corresponding to a person's age (in days) and print it in years, months and days, followed by its respective message “ano(s)”, “mes(es)”, “dia(s)”.

Note: only to facilitate the calculation, consider the whole year with 365 days and 30 days every month. In the cases of test there will never be a situation that allows 12 months and some days, like 360, 363 or 364. This is just an exercise for the purpose of testing simple mathematical reasoning.

## Input
The input file contains 1 integer value.

## Output
Print the output, like the following example.

| Input Samples |              Output Samples              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| 400           | 1 ano(s)<br> 1 mes(es)<br> 5 dia(s)<br>  | 
| 800           | 2 ano(s)<br> 2 mes(es)<br> 10 dia(s)<br> |
| 30            | 0 ano(s)<br> 1 mes(es)<br> 0 dia(s)<br>  |
