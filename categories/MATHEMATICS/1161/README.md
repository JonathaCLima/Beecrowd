# Factorial Sum
Read two numbers M and N indefinitely. Calculate and write the sum of their factorial. Be carefull, because the result can have more than 15 digits.

## Input
The input file contains many test cases. Each test case contains two integer numbers M (0 ≤ M ≤ 20) and N (0 ≤ N ≤ 20). The end of file is determined by eof.

## Output
For each test case in the input your program must print a single line, containing a number that is the sum of the both factorial (M and N).
